# SASS-practice

This training project is about creating photoshop template of landing page. It was made via SASS preprocessor and Gulp toolkit.
On purpose of fixing CSS scalability issue I used BEM methodology. Also the overall design was not pixel perfect. Run `npm install` and `gulp` for a dev server.
